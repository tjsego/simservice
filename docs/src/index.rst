SimService
===========

SimService is a library for building simulation services in Python.
SimService is lightweight, written in pure Python and designed to generate
memory-isolated, interactive proxy objects of simulations with minimal effort.
SimService is especially designed to encapsulate stateful simulations,
simulation libraries and frameworks for usage in general Python environments
as interactive objects that can be integrated into larger computational workflows
and interconnected in multi-method models and simulations. In support of simulation
frameworks, SimService provides support for customizing the interface of service
proxies at multiple levels of an underlying service, both statically in a service
implementation, as well as dynamically in the specification of a simulation.
